# cs231n-Spring2017

Solutions for [Stanford cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/index.html) assignments.


## Some Notes

### Assignment1

- The notebooks and solutions are compatible with python2.

### Assignment2

- For question 5, only complete `TensorFlow.ipynb`.

- The original `TensorFlow.ipynb` is not compatible with python2. I have added one line in cell 2 to import `division` from `__future__`. 

- All my solutions work well with python2, but I'm not sure whether they are good with python3.

- Still working on more different models to improve the performance on CIFAR-10.

### Assignment3

- For the framework specific assignments, only complete **TensorFlow** ones.

- All the notebooks are compatible with python2.

- I have writen my own notebook **AdversarialExamples-TensorFlow.ipynb** to play with adversarial examples described in the [Guest Lecture](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) by Ian Goodfellow. If you are interested with it, please help me improve it.

- Still updating cool things.
